    Cubic interpolation of the function f(x) at the sample i + a is a weighted sum of the 4 nearest neighbour samples: 
    \[ f_{i+\alpha} = w_0f_{i-1}+w_1f_{i}+w_2f_{i+1}+w_3f_{i+2}\]
    Where we choose weightings based on uniform cubic B-splines:
    \[ w_0 = 1/6(-\alpha^3+3\alpha^2-\alpha+1) \]
    \[ w_1 = 1/6(3\alpha^3-6\alpha^2+4) \]
    \[ w_2 = 1/6(-3\alpha^3+3\alpha^2+1) \]
    \[ w_3 = 1/6\alpha^3 \]
    Note that the B-splines do not pass trough \( f_i \) or \( f_{i+1} \).

    <br />
    Since linear interpolation is implemented in hardware on the graphics card we want to express this sum in terms of two linearly interpolated values. <br />
    Linear interpolation takes the form
    \[ f_{i+\alpha} = (1-\alpha)f_i+\alpha f_{i+1}\]
    Consider a weighted sum of two consecutive samples:
    \( s = af_i+bf_{i+1}\)
    We guess that this can be expressed as a scaled linear interpolation:
    \( s = \beta f_{i+\alpha} \)
    <br />
    In which case:
    \( a = (1-\alpha)\beta\)
    and
    \( b = \alpha\beta\).
    For this to hold we must have: 
    \( \beta = (a+b) \)
    and
    \( \alpha = b/(a+b) \)
    Therefore 
    \[ af_i+bf_{i+1} = (a+b)f_{i+b/(a+b)} \]
    Applying this twice:
    \[ f_{i+\alpha} = (w_0+w_1)f_u+(w_2+w_3)f_v \]
    where
    \[ u=i-1+\frac{w_1}{w_0+w_1}\]
    and
    \[ v=i+1+\frac{w_3}{w_2+w_3}\]
 
    <h3>B spline interpolation</h3>
    <img src="Bspline.PNG" width="200" height="200" />
    \[ f_{i+s,j+t}= \sum_{k=-1}^2 \sum_{l=-1}^2B_k(s)B_l(t)f_{i+k,j+l} \]
    where 
    \[ 0<=s<=1 \] 
    \[ 0<=t<=1 \] 
    \[ B_0(s) = 1/6(-s^3+3s^2-s+1) \]
    \[ B_1(s) = 1/6(3s^3-6s^2+4) \]
    \[ B_2(s) = 1/6(-3s^3+3s^2+1) \]
    \[ B_3(s) = 1/6s^3 \]
